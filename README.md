# Textual Entailment

## Summary

This project is a short exploration of textual entailment. The experiments compare the performance of three different models:
1. A naive bayes classifier using tf-idf vectors
2. A neural network using BERT embeddings
3. OpenAI's text-davinci-002 model using prompt design

A complete write up of the results is [here]().

## Example Usage

Preprocess text

Embed text with BERT
